                    <h2>Ichigo's Best Fights IMO</h2>
                    <p>
                        Ichigo's battle with Ulquiorra is one of the best in the series and has a transformation that's top tier. It was the
                        type of power-up that came a bit out of nowhere, but when it looks as cool as this one did, no one is going to complain.
                        The interesting aspect is that once he takes on his new hollow form, his badge breaks, as shown in a few chapter
                        sketches. It's an interesting tidbit, showing that Ichigo's shinigami side was no longer in control.
                        </p>

                                This was one of the most consequential fight scenes during the Soul Society arc, and it has a personal edge, too. Ichigo
                                and his friends infiltrated the Soul Society to rescue Rukia from her cruel fate, and Renji made sure to stand in their
                                way with his sword drawn.
